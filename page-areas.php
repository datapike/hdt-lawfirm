			<h2>Employment Law</h2>
			<p>Employment law can have a significant impact on almost every business. The rights and obligations of employers and employees are dictated by a complicated mix of federal, state and local laws. Understanding the intricacies of employment law is vital in this sometimes emotional realm, but effective and empathetic counsel can assist employers and employees in successfully resolving difficult situations. </p>
			<p>Henry, David, and Thoreau attorneys draft employee handbooks, employment agreements, noncompete agreements and severance agreements. We provide counsel on all employment documents. HDT also represents employers and employees in all matters of employment law before the courts, agencies, boards and commissions that preside over employment disputes.  </p>

			<h2>Land Use and Zoning Law</h2>
			<p>Land use and development is a highly regulated and complex field that requires an intimate knowledge of both the law and the governmental and political framework that is necessary for effective legal representation. Henry, David, and Thoreau has grown, developed and adapted to continue to provide aggressive representation to correspond with the ever-changing and publicly- and politically-charged field of zoning and land use regulations.</p>
			<p>HDT has represented clients in matters before planning boards and commissions, hearing examiners and zoning boards in Howard County, Baltimore County, Baltimore City, and Anne Arundel County. HDT represents clients in matters before all government agencies that have a role in land use and development in these jurisdictions as well as before the state of Maryland agencies. </p>

			<h2>Liquor Licensing Law</h2>
			<p>Restaurants, taverns and liquor stores need approval from the local liquor board to sell alcoholic beverages. Liquor laws are different in every Maryland county and city. To successfully navigate the complex laws and ensure applicants and businesses receive the necessary and vital approval from the local liquor board requires an uncommon level of attention to the details and subtle differences in the laws from county to county.</p>
			<p>Henry, David, and Thoreau has successfully represented national, regional and local businesses in the unique field of liquor licensing law for more than 30 years.</p>
